      <h1>Roguelikes.</h1>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Really is the hot new thing these days huh,</p>
    <p>I remmember my brother actually playing Rogue when I was a kid, I never really got into it I was more into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck%27s_Playground">Donald Duck</a> 
      at the time, grinding money and upgrading my playground. But many years later I did get into rogue likes, and I never grew out of it. </p> 

      <p>
        One of the earliest roguelikes I remember playing and at the same time my favorite rogue like - I still play it frequently to this day. FTL: Faster Than Light - It is an amazing combination of randomness, strategy and firefighter/spaceship sim.
      </p>

      <p>
        The great thing that makes me come back to FTL (besides the modding community) is its simplicity in its gameplay, there is the fighting scene, you see above - there is an alternative scene without an enemy space ship, and there is a map. 
        Most of the content takes place inside these scenes with dialog windows and story line decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing I want to note, is the strategy part of FTL. This is a rare combination of gameplay - not many have tried and even less succeeded (looking at you pixel piracy).

      <h5>The platforming roguelikes</h5>


    <p>I loved platformers growing up, Super Mario World (and its many kaizo clones!) 
      is one of the best games ever made in my opinion, and I can write a thesis on why - but now is not the time. So I got into games like wanna be the guy / boshy games quite early and learned to tkae it on the chin. When I started playing playforming roguelikes like Risk of Rain and later on Dead Cells it just felt right. 
      These games felt so polished, the movement is smooth the combat is amazing and so. very. rewarding. I think these 2 along with FTL are my favorite roguelike games in existence.   </p>

      <div class="tip tip-right">
        <p>
          Risk of Rain is a 2013 platform video game incorporating Metroidvania and roguelike elements, developed by a two-student team from the University of Washington under the name Hopoo Games.

      <div class="tip tip-left">
        <p>
          Dead Cells is a roguelike-metroidvania video game developed and published by Motion Twin. Dead Cells was released on August 7, 2018.

      </figure>

      <p>
        The movement and combat in Dead Cells is even more impressive, if you've played the game you know what I mean. But what makes me consider dead cells to be such a top tier game 
        along side its movement and combat mechanics, is its replayability - something I value greatly in roguelike games. 
        The problem I have with good classical (J)RPG's is that you get powerfull, and then the game is over. In a good roguelike the game is just getting started at that point. 
        The first time you clear the 'final boss' in dead cells, grats - you finished the tutorial, now we can begin.
      </p>

      <h5>The reward system</h5>
      <p>Can not talk about roguelikes without talking about that special carrot on a stick that makes roguelikes.. well. roguelikes.</p>
      <p>Some roguelikes like FTL have unlockable alternative starts, games like undermine have stat upgrades that carry over to new runs and games like dead cells and risk of rain have unlockables, new items you can find in new runs making them 'easier'</p>
      <p>There are some similarities in roguelike games with overlapping genres, e.g. caveblazers and dungreed in the outfits and starter runes respectivly. </p>

      <h5>Loottable balance</h5>
      <p>In games like dead cells and undermine you find blueprints for weapons or skills that you can decide to unlock for future runs, these usually add to the loot table of the game.
      <p>The player has the decision to add or ignore these additions to the loottable, personally - I am unsure if that is the right decision or not - but I suppose balancing out a loot table for these games is a very tough job, so why not let the player do it themselves?</p>

      <h4>Sooo what I want to do</h4>    
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Last year I've spent some months working on a 2D sidescrolling pirate sim roguelike, mostly because I was frustrated with the implementations I've seen. 
      But quickly I came to the realisation that there are a TON of design issues in 2D 'crew management' games. 
      The biggest one would be do you let your objects stack on eachother ? So 3 enemies could be inside eachother, or do they block eachother etc etc. 
      I tried for some months to come up with 'workable' solutions but realised I was putting bandaids on something that needed to be put down. 

    </p>
<p>What is next</p>

<p>For a while now I've been working on a design for a medieval kingdom mangement game. I've only been working on small prototypes to verify implementation of design decisions and artwork so far - but so far a lot less design issues</p>

<p>Well.. besides finding a good balance in combining game elements and actually creating the damn game.</p>
  <p>Annnd thats it for today, to be updated at some point.</p>
