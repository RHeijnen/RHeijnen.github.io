                                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Note: The company on whose behalf I was doing the project had rights to use Disney trademarks.</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                            </div>
                            <p>During my minor studies me and a group of students got an assignment to create an loyalty program for supermarket chains. 
                                The company we were working for had full rights from Disney, so we were free to use disney trademarks to create a Proof of Concept for a supermarket 
                                loyalty program. </p>
                         
                                 <p>In those days supermarket chain Albert Heijn here in the Netherlands was HUGE with their loyalty programs. For every N euro's spend you get something 
                                   your kids want. For years they have been going with soccer images but recently they have been going into other areas like 3D dinosaurs. 
                                   I dont get it personally, but kids seem to go nuts over these, to the point where supermarkets had to take measures to prevent children from pestering adults
                                   when they were done shopping.</p>
                         
                                 <p>
                                   We went trough many, many itteration of ideas, trying to apply what we learned from our research into the psychology of loyalty programs 
                                   and trying to create something we could present with pride to our customer. We wanted to include the fact that we could use Disneys
                                    ever growing library of stories into our project, so we decided around a 'setting' before we got to our actual idea.</p>
                                 <p>
                                     We wanted to create a setting where child and parent together have an shared bed time experience. So we wanted individual stories to be the actual 'collectibles' 
                                     from the supermarket, even possible to split up a story into multiple collectibles so you would need to collect something else to complete the story.
                                 </p>

                                 <p>
                                    So I started to toy around with the idea to represent digital stories on a smartphone, where an adult could narate the story and the child could hold the phone and watch the story unfold.
                                  </p>
                                  <figure class="center">
                                    <img src="./resources/holopyramid.jpg" alt="Big Ass Image">
                                    <figcaption>At one point we looked into the costs of mass producing these hologram pyramids to show these stories</figcaption>
                                  </figure> 
                          
                                  <p> To add to the involvement with the story we decided to add very simple minigames that were part of the story and needed to be solved before the story could continue.</p>
                                  <p> I decided to implement an image recognition algorithm to scan the phone camera for 'cards' see below, and if it found a valid one from its picture database that we set up, it would unlock the coresponding story.</p>
                          
                                  <figure class="center">
                                    <img src="./resources/scanout.jpg" alt="Big Ass Image">
                                    <figcaption>For technical reasons you want these to be as small as possible.</figcaption>
                                  </figure> 
                                  <blockquote>
                                    <h4>Result</h4>
                                  </blockquote>
                                  <p>So below is a proof of concept I made of that idea, besides it not being designed to work like this (it was supposed to be installed on a phone) it has many flaws like not having  mouse support (so.. navigation tip: small swipes, mouse down -> small move -> mouse up) and the asset sizes are handeld poorly, 
                                    but hey I was a student and it was a quick and dirty proof of concept. This might also explain why this page is rendering poorly, I am loading the app in an IFrame with no regard for responsiveness. <br> 
                                  There is one story worked out - Dory (the blue fish at the start.) But you will get stuck at the first minigame without touch.</p>
