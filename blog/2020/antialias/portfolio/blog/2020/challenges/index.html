      <h1>The importance of challenging yourself</h1>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So I think we've all been there, stuck in trying to improve - be it in sports, arts, school, programming or competitively eating jars of mayonnaise. </p>
    <p>What do ?</p>

      Lets not pretend I am qualified to give anyone any advice on this, I did not go to school for that - hell lets not pretend anyone will ever read this. But hey, I can write down what works for me, to atleast remind myself of it - words have been spoken and this is online afterall.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <h6>So what works for me ?</h6>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Whenever I feel I am stuck progressing something - and that happens frequently while programming, drawing or playing guitar. 
      I try to form a realistic goal, and this is where all that college money finally pays off - 
      I formulate it <span class="custom-bold">SMART</span>, Specific Measurable Acceptable Realistic Timebased.  
    </p><p>
      So try to form a challenge for yourself, but be fair (make sure it is attainable and realistic) and specific, so you have a clear scope of what you will and wont do before you start.
      If halfway through you get a burst of creativity and want to do extra, sure - aslong as its within the time restraints you set for yourself. 
    </p>

      If you have some programming knowledge it might be a great idea to start participating in Ludum Dare - If you are an pixelartist you might want to check out pixeldailies. These are premade challenges that have communities that participate, if you are like me and have trouble fitting these in your schedual, there is nothing stopping you from just picking 
      one from random and doing it on your own, there are no rules.
      The great thing about these premade challenges is that they already give you a subject, if you are stuck drawing and not sure what to do - Hey todays challenge is a lighthouse, see how that goes.

    <blockquote>
      <h6>Importance of goals</h6>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This might be redundant at this point, but the importance of goals is so we can measure our progress. Without tangible targets, we have nothing to strive for and we are just in a directionless flow of sorts. Set goals, try to achieve them - failure is always an option, there is no need to succeed everytime, that is the reason you are trying to improve in the first place.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <h6>Learn from others</h6>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This one seems so obvious but it still needs saying, there is no shame in copying others. 
      For fellow programmers this is second nature, but I noticed artists are hesitant to try out something they see someone else do. 
      I am not condoning stealing someone else's work and pretending its yours, but how many games have slime enemies ? See how other games picture them, see how other people have animated them etc. Learn and get inspired from other people!
    </p>



    <p>Thats it for now, to be updated I suppose.</p>
