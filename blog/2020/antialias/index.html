    <p>What is it, what does it do, why do I need it.</p>
    <p>I think a lot of people know that it exists, but not what it actually does. Untill recently I was one of those people, I decided to do a writeup of my experiences studying anti aliasing.</p>
    <div class="tip tip-right">

    <p>Antialiassing(Anti-aliassing ? Anti Alliasing? AA.) AA is a technique used to smooth out rough edges. Since the rendering of graphics is done with SQUARE pixels, things can end up looking kinda "jagged" Jaggies anyone?</p>
    <figure>

      <figcaption>- codinghorror.com</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>So the rightside obviously looks smoother, but why is that ? </p>
    <p>When we apply AA, rough edges get smoothed out, by adding transition colors. Take a look at this simple example down below:</p>
    <figure class="center">
        <img src="/blog/2020/antialias/resources/lineexample.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
        <figcaption>Look at those jaggies!</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When we look at the big picture, it does not look great eitherway yet, but it is obvious that the bottom one is smoother. So by adding color transitions to corners we can smooth them out. Lets zoom out.</p>
      <figure class="center">
        <img src="/blog/2020/antialias/resources/lineexample-zoomed.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
        <figcaption>Much better</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>And zoomed out it looks much smoother - and that is a simple form of antialias.</p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>Jaggies in pixel art are easily described as unncessary/accidental corners. When you free hand draw something you will easily get these jagged looking corners. In pixel art we should remove these and smooth out our shape before we even start thinking of anti aliasing.</p>
      <figure class="center">
        <img src="/blog/2020/antialias/resources/jaggedcorner.gif" alt="Big Ass Image">
        <figcaption> Noticed how (rounded) corners follow a mirrored pattern? </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It is easier if you practise a long, draw a cury line and remove the jaggies like so:</p>
      <figure class="center">
        <img src="/blog/2020/antialias/resources/jaggedfix.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
        <figcaption> Left: Free hand curvy line | Right: removed jaggies </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>See how after cleaning up the line it already becomes more rounded in places ? No more sharp edges, child proof!</p>


      <p>In pixelart we do not want to apply any (post) anti aliasing at all, it will make your sprites look fuzzy. So for anyone reading this wondering why their sprites look fuzzy in Unity, thats why. </p>

        <p>We do however want to apply it ourselves. look at this artwork from Pedro Medeiros one of the creators of Celeste.</p>
        <figure class="center">
          <img src="/blog/2020/antialias/resources/pedroalias.png" alt="Big Ass Image">
          <figcaption> https://medium.com/pixel-grimoire/how-to-start-making-pixel-art-4-ff4bfcd2d085  </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> Notice on the left the image is aliased - on the right he applied some manual anti-aliasing. I find it adds more character and gives the subject more depth, the left image looks to 'pop out' more in comparison.</p>
